## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I faced some problems that were really trivial but that required me plenty of time to came up with a solution. For example it took me a while to obtain the right result for the image. I knew mix-blend-mode and all the other properties that I used at the end but to put them together I had to experiment for some time.

### Continued development

I have to become faster in setting the markup and the styling. I'll practice on some other challenges in HTML and CSS before adding Javascript too.
